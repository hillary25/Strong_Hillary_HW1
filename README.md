This is the hw repo for Authoring 1 HW 1.

Homework 1 for authoring class is to make a website about me. It should include text about hobbies, interests, where I am from, etc. Also, it should showcase images to go along with what I am talking about.

When the main file is opened, you will find assets, css, images, includes, js and an html file. You will need a coding program to open up my code, and then use this to view my website on a broswer - note: I used Chrome to view my webpage from home.
